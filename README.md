# cykodigo

A little silly discord bot :3

# Build

I don't think building, dependencies and etc. needs an explanation, building is `go build .` and everything else is managed by Go

# Notes

If you really want to use bot source code (for some reason), make sure you:

- Credit me
- Change the paths to the resources or add your own with the same paths.
  Resources are NOT included in this repository for legal reasons and blah blah
- Change the emoji IDs in `emoji.go` and their use in the code

I'm not so good at Go, I picked it up just for fun, so if you see some bad code or bad practice feel free to open an issue ^\_^
