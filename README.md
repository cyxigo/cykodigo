# cykodigo

A little silly discord bot, feel free to use its code (don't forget to credit me) :>

I don't think building dependencies and etc. needs an explanation, building is `go build .` and everything else is managed by Go

# Note

I'm not so good at Go, I picked it up just for fun, so if you see some bad code or bad practice feel free to open an issue ^\_^

Also, if you have a silly cat image (in `.png` format, that's important) that isn't in `res/cat` open an issue immediately!
